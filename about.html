        <h3>Japan is one of the most volcanic countries in the world, with around 111 currently active volcanoes.</h3>
        <p> This includes Niigata prefecture, which is susceptible to many kinds of geohazards. Niigata University has a long history of scientific expertise regarding disaster resilience and fundamental volcano science as well as the practical side of volcanology: working alongside those in volcano observatories or related non-academic institutions who are at the frontline of eruption preparedness, hazard mitigation, and crisis response.</p>
        <p>Niigata University’s 1st International Symposium on <i>Volcanology in Practice</i> will take place in Niigata, Japan between the 7th and 10th of October 2025, followed by optional field excursions to local volcanic sites. The conference will facilitate interaction, networking, and knowledge sharing between scientists and practitioners in Japan and those overseas. This will help develop and strengthen connections within and between Japan and the international volcanology community, allow international scientists to learn how Japan effectively manages volcano hazards, and showcase the cutting-edge of volcano monitoring and research equipment. With a growing roster of eminent keynote speakers and a schedule of both academic and public activities, the symposium is set to be an exciting event, advancing the application of volcano science to real-world challenges.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-5">Bringing together volcano scientists, innovators, and practitioners from around the world.</h3>
        <p>The conference will bring together volcano scientists, innovators, and practitioners from around the world, bridging the gap between research, technology development, and volcanic hazard mitigation. Niigata University's <a href="https://www.irp.niigata-u.ac.jp/" target="_blank">Institute for Research Administration</a> and <a href="https://www.nhdr.niigata-u.ac.jp/en/" target="_blank">Research Institute for Natural Hazards and Disaster Recovery</a> have teamed up with international partners to organise a symposium addressing crucial themes in volcanic research and application.</p>
        <p>The symposium will be split between <b>three broad interconnected themes</b>, each co-hosted by a different partner. These themes are "<i>Exposure, preparedness, and risk reduction”</i> (co-organised by the <a href="https://www.globalvolcanoriskalliance.com/" target="_blank">Global Volcanic Risk Alliance</a>); “<i>The next generation of volcano monitoring</i>" (co-organised by <a href="https://www.volcanotech.co.uk/" target="_blank">VolcanoTech</a>); and “<i>Knowledge-sharing</i>” (co-organised by the <a href="https://kazan.bosai.go.jp/en/acv/" target="_blank">Asian Consortium of Volcanology</a>).</p>
        <p>Key aims are to facilitate new ideas and collaborations, to showcase innovative monitoring technology, and to share scientific, technical, and practical knowledge. Find out more about each of our partners on the <a href="partners.html">Partners</a> page.</p>
        <p><strong>There will be no cost for registration</strong> for the main conference. The optional field excursions will have a fee to cover incurred costs (details to follow).</p>
